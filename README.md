### LED Blinking with Arduino Nano

#### Project Overview

This simple project demonstrates how to use an Arduino Nano to blink an LED on and off at one-second intervals. This project is a fundamental exercise to familiarize yourself with basic Arduino programming and circuit building.

#### Components Needed and Block Diagram

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **LED**
3. **220Ω Resistor**
4. **Breadboard and Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram



#### Circuit Setup

1. **Arduino Nano to LED:**
   - Connect the anode (long leg) of the LED to digital pin 13 on the Arduino Nano through a 220Ω resistor.
   - Connect the cathode (short leg) of the LED to the GND pin on the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the LED and resistor to the Arduino Nano as described above and shown in the circuit diagram.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Connect your Arduino Nano to your computer using a USB cable.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Select the appropriate board (Arduino Nano) and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, observe the LED blinking on and off at one-second intervals.

#### Applications

- **Indicator Lights:** Use blinking LEDs as indicators for various states in projects.
- **Learning Tool:** This project is perfect for beginners to understand basic Arduino programming and circuit building.

#### Notes

- Ensure correct orientation and connection of the LED and resistor to prevent damage.
- Experiment with different delay values to change the blinking frequency of the LED.
